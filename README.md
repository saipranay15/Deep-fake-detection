# Deep-fake-detection
projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like RestNext and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained RestNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features.
